The Application Model is a Abstraction of the Sequelize Model Definition. It can loads multiple Model Definitions and join them over foreign Keys.

```javascript
'use strict';

// import the BaseModel
const { BaseModel } = require('./../index');

// extends from BaseModel
class Demo extends BaseModel {
    constructor () {
        // call super with the name of the Sequelize Model Definition
        // the BaseModel looks for the Sequelize Model in the Definition Core
        super('public.demo1');
    }
}
```

Now you can call create, load, save or delete on Demo Class to do CRUD Operations.
